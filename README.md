## About Me
I am Rahul Hans. Currently, I have been affiliated with DAV University in Jalandhar, Punjab, India, since 2014. I successfully completed my PhD in Computer Science at Guru Nanak Dev University, India, in November 2021 specializing in the design of innovative Nature-Inspired Metaheuristic Algorithms for Feature Selection in Machine Learning. Over the past twelve years, I have also accumulated extensive teaching experience and am currently mentoring three PhD students. Furthermore, I have successfully guided master of technology students, resulting in significant research publications. The focus of my doctoral studies was on the development of the improvised variants of the Nature-Inspired Metaheuristic Algorithms for getting into the bottom of Feature Selection problem in Machine Learning. I performed a great deal of experiments on various standard datasets of different sizes to gauge the performance of the algorithms. Apart from this, I worked on the feature selection for the Breast Density Classification and Breast Mass Classification problems, for the screening of the breast abnormality in mammogram images. My doctoral studies fortified my research foundation, particularly in deep learning and feature selection. In recent times, collaborating with Professor Uwe Aickelin, we made substantial contributions to Optimizing Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnoses, a testament to my prolific research output. Furthermore, I possess a good knowledge of programming languages like C/C++, Java, Python and has a hands on experience in working with tools like Matlab. During my PhD, to gauge the performance of the algorithms, I executed various existing and proposed algorithms on Matlab. In recent times, I amalgamated and programmed the notions of deep learning and nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms to develop a model for the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. Of late, I am working in improving the predictive accuracy of transfer learning models for disease classification in medical images using Keras. In recent times, I worked on Breast Mass Pattern Classification using Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Implemented using Pytorch) which has been accepted as conference article in the International Conference on Healthcare Innovation and Smart Systems (ICHISS 2024).
