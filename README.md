## About Me 
<div align="justify">
Hi.. I am Rahul Hans. I have been affiliated with DAV University in Jalandhar, Punjab, India. I successfully completed my PhD in Computer Science specializing in the design of innovative Nature-Inspired Metaheuristic Algorithms for Feature Selection in Machine Learning. The focus of my doctoral studies was on the development of the improvised variants of the Nature-Inspired Metaheuristic Algorithms for getting into the bottom of Feature Selection problem in Machine Learning. Apart from this, I worked on the feature selection for the Breast Density Classification and Breast Mass Classification problems, for the screening of the breast abnormality in mammogram images. My doctoral studies fortified my research foundation, particularly in deep learning and feature selection. In recent times, collaborating with Professor Uwe Aickelin, we made substantial contributions to Optimizing Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnoses, a testament to my prolific research output. Furthermore, I possess a good knowledge of programming languages including C/C++, Java, Python and has a hands on experience in working with tools like Matlab. Of late, I am working in improving the predictive accuracy of transfer learning models for disease classification in medical images using Keras. In my most recent work, I worked on Breast Mass Pattern Classification using Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Implemented using Pytorch) which has been accepted as conference article in the International Conference on Healthcare Innovation and Smart Systems (ICHISS 2024). For more details regarding on-going research and publications, my curriculum vitae can be seen in given tab.
